When I tell someone that I'm learning to code, I can expect to get a couple different reactions:

1. "That sounds hard!"
2. "You're brave. Aren't you concerned about being a woman in tech?"
3. "I've always wanted to learn."

Changing my career path after the age of 30 was, undoubtedly, a hard path to forge but it was one of the easiest decisions I've ever made.  However, as I reflect on the reactions of my friends and family, I can't help but pull apart each reaction to my decision.

**"That sounds hard!"**

...which is exactly why I'm making the change. The worst roadblock to hit in your professional journey is to feel unchallenged and unfufilled. Your brain turns to mush, your skills become outdated and your drive to do better takes a nosedive. This is where I found myself. I felt like I was floating in my day-to-day life. I barely had to perform and still I was "exceeding expectations". I checked off the boxes of my job description, but was I being kind to myself by simply checking those boxes?

**"You're brave. Aren't you concerned about being a woman in tech?"**

Most of my career has been spent empowering others to pursue higher education. A degree is possible, attainable, and achievable with the right resources and mentorship. Is going into a male-dominated field intimidating? Slightly. However, I hope to use my past experiences to feed my determination to do well in a thriving field.

I know that being a software engineer will be a challenge, but I look forward to flexing my creative muscles, I look forward to working with problem solvers and self starters, and, most importantly, I look forward to feeling fulfilled by the work I do.

**"I've always wanted to learn."**

So have I. After some reflection, I realized that my whole life I have been drawn towards coding. The highlights of my childhood were building silly websites, changing the details of my avatar, or expressing myself through the design and layout of my Xanga. I'm ready to shift my adulthood back towards my roots, and I think I'm brave enough to make that change.
