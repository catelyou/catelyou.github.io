Before I write my first blog about my code, I thought it was important to share my experiences with going back to school as an adult. When I started Flatiron, I thought that I would be able to dive in head first: "I graduated with my Master's degree with a decent GPA, I knew how to study, how to manage my time. I've done it before!" **Oh, boy**. The last time I was this wrong, I wore shorts hiking on Assateague Island during the Zika scare. Can you say "Mosquito Bite City"?

I found it impossible to balance coding part-time with working full time in a job that requires a ton of travel, managing the care of an aging parent, continuing my recovery from cancer, all while making sure my marriage doesn't fall apart in the meantime. **Oh, boy.**

So, how do I plan to get back on track with Flatiron? I broke down my six-month plan into three points I want to adhere to:

#### 1. Commit to Life Changes
Making a career change is terrifying but the worst thing you can do is cling to what is comfortable. Staying comfortable in an unfulfilling situation (whether job or relationship) closes more doors than it opens. So, I made the decision to leave my soul-sucking job to focus on going to school full-time. Will not having a paycheck stink? Sure. But I will be happier, more determined and more focused on learning.

#### 2. Be Confident in My Education
While I have not been coding as much as I should be, and to be frank that's been embarassing, I have learned so much about code and engineering so far. The most important lesson I've taken away has been the ability to *read*. This may seem simple but learning how to read instructions, lessons and failed tests has been my AHA! moment since starting the online program. Don't get me wrong, I have a long way to go, but seeing how much I've improved since practicing *reading* has been eye opening.

Flatiron's program will have me on track. I will encounter bumps and bruises along the way, but I just need to keep going...which brings me to my last point.

#### 3. Value Mentorship and Community
One of the huge perks about being an online learner located in New York City is that I have access to so many opportunities for connection. Between WeWork, Flatiron's campus and community organizations like Women Who Code, I have no excuse to sit at home and code on my own all the time. I thrive on community, I find inspiration from others and I'm fueled by being in a creative community. Thankfully, I'm lucky to already have an amazing mentor who has been a huge support for me through this journey but I can't rely on only his expertise.

So, let's see where this takes me. I may fall flat on my face but at least I can say that I tried, even if I had to re-evaluate being a student again.
